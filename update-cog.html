                        <h1>Creative Writing Project: Choice of Games</h1>
                        <p>As of May 10, 2023, I've finished the first chapter of my game for Choice of Games/ Hosted Games. Choice of Games/ Hosted Games is a platform for publishing choose-your-own-adventure types of games. The sleek user interface and back-end programming language ChoiceScript allow users to "play" a game and not simply "read" a story. Imagine playing a video game, but much more narrative-driven and, well, in the form of a written story.</p>
                        <p>I have nurtured several creative writing projects for a long time, but the majority never matured. This current project is one that did. It brings me much excitement to share this story of a future society where the technological advancement of humankind dominates all other human needs - a story of a protagonist pondering the ethics and philosophy of transferring one's own consciousness into an ideal android body.</p>
                        <p>I will post updates to the website once I have crossed another milestone, potentially: publishing a demo of the completely coded first chapter on the Choice of Games/ Hosted Games forum.</p>
