                        <h1>My current research</h1>
                        <p>Working with Dr. Tashauna Blankenship, my interests have evolved to encompass the field of episodic future thinking (EFT) in tandem with Theory of Mind (ToM). In short, I am currently interested in the ability of children to imagine the future for someone else. Below are three of my current projects:</p>
                        <h2>Episodic memory aids EFT for another (new project)</h2>
                        <p>In a developing project, I ask what the commonalities and differences are between EFT for the self and another. Neurophysiological research has found overlapping networks for reasoning about the self and another (Buckner & Carroll, 2007; Hassabis & Maguire, 2007) and other researchers have found distinct pathways when thinking for another (van Veluw & Chance, 2013; Saxe et al., 2016). Cognitively, is there some underlying process that aids with both EFT for the self and another? This project is in initial design phase and will be updated once we have finalized our design and preregistration.</p>
                        <h2>EFT for another with ToM component</h2>
                        <p>Some works have shown a correlation between ToM and EFT (Atance & Jackson, 2009; Suddendorf & Corballis, 2007) and others donâ€™t (Hanson et al., 2014). We were inspired by a study by Belanger et al. (2014) where children indicated what they would like when they are an adult, choosing between a child-item and an adult-item. We added a different block to the study where children reason about their preferences in the short-term. We are in the middle of data collection. However, preliminary analyses convey that the short-term block is easier for children ages 4-5, but the advantage of psychological distance prevails even in this block.</p>
                        <h2>Memory-guided planning and ToM</h2>
                        <p>There are potential relationships between memory-guided planning, executive functions, and ToM (Atance & Jackson, 2009; Hanson et al., 2014). My advisor, Dr. Tashauna Blankenship, and Dr. Alleyne Broomell of Western Carolina University devised a joint memory-guided planning and ToM task, the first to utilize both aspects. Children play a game where they get to make plans for two different characters, one with the same preference as them (congruent) and one with a different preference (incongruent). I added three additional tasks of executive function, ToM, and EFT to explore correlations between the tasks. The project is nearing the end of data collection and we have some preliminary analyses suggesting that the ability to plan for another improves with age.</p>
                        <h2>Other projects</h2>
                        <p>I am currently aiding Dr. Blankenship on another project related to memory-guided planning in its manuscript phase. I am also collaborating with <a class="posts" href="https://manybabies.org/MB2/">the ManyBabies consortium</a> on a large-scale replication project on eye tracking in ToM.
